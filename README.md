This project was developed during a group project under the supervision of a Professor, specializing in image processing. It explores the use of facial and hand landmark detection for potential applications in lie detection. It leverages libraries like mediapipe, opencv-python, and fer to accomplish various functionalities.

Note: This project is a work-in-progress (WIP) and does not aim to be a conclusive method for lie detection.
